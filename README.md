Use the keyboard in the window to play the game. Guess the letters in the hidden word using the hint and other clues. Each correct selection reveals the letter at its correct position(s) replacing one or more of the dashes in the hidden word and each incorrect guess reveals a part of a hanged stickman! If you select all the letters occuring in the full word before five incorrect selections then the man is saved and you win the game, otherwise the stickman is fully hanged and you loose.
